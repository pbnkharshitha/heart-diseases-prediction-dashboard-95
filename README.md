Using a trained machine learning model, the dashboard analyzes user input such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators to provide a real-time risk assessment. It also includes visual insights, data analytics, and correlations among various health factors to support better decision-making.

This project demonstrates the integration of data science, machine learning, and interactive visualization in healthcare, offering an easy-to-use interface for both educational and practical purposes.
